# Clio — Architecture (B2B Pivot)

Version: 1.0 | Produced by: Business Analyst Agent, as part of B2B-02
Source Feature Brief: `.claude/agents/clio/feature-briefs/B2B-02-partner-api-multi-tenant-architecture.md`
Requirement Document: `docs/specs/B2B-02-requirement-document.md`
Schema migrations: `supabase/migrations/071_b2b02_partner_accounts_and_api_keys.sql`,
`supabase/migrations/072_b2b02_usage_events_resolution_a.sql`

Per `CLAUDE.md`: no `architecture.md` existed for the pivoted system before this brief. This file is
scoped to exactly what B2B-02 covers — partner accounts, API keys, the session-initiation contract,
the content/profile push-pull contract, and the usage-metering/signed-webhook mechanism. It is not a
speculative full schema for B2B-03 (Designer/Configurator), B2B-04 (Billing/metering), or B2B-05
(Domain/white-label infra) — each of those will extend this document when their own Feature Brief
lands.

## 1. Two Auth Systems — Do Not Conflate

| | Clerk | Partner API Keys |
|---|---|---|
| **Who it authenticates** | A human at a partner company (Capgemini/Pluralsight) logging into Clio's own UI | A partner's backend system calling Clio's API programmatically |
| **Scope** | Partner-admin accounts only — never end-user identity, in any form | One partner account (machine-to-machine) |
| **Where it's used** | Configurator/Designer/billing UI (B2B-03), key management endpoints (this brief) | Session-initiation, usage-read endpoints (this brief) |
| **Owned by** | B2B-01 (unchanged by this brief) | New in this brief |
| **Bridge table** | `partner_admin_users` (Clerk user ID ↔ partner_account_id) | `partner_api_keys` (hash ↔ partner_account_id) |

**Routing convention that makes this unmistakable at a glance:** every partner-API-key-authenticated
route lives under `/api/partner/v1/*`. Every Clerk-authenticated partner-admin route (key management,
future Configurator) lives under Clio's existing internal `/api/*` / `/dashboard/*` convention,
protected by the existing Clerk `middleware.ts`. A developer should never need to open a route file to
know which auth model applies — the path prefix tells them.

A Clerk-authenticated partner-admin **cannot** rotate or revoke their own API keys using an API key —
that would be a bootstrapping problem (you'd need a key to manage your keys). Key management is
Clerk-authenticated only; runtime partner→Clio calls are API-key-authenticated only. Neither system is
ever a valid credential for the other's routes.

## 2. Bidirectional API — Two Different Auth Directions

```
Partner's backend  ──[Authorization: Bearer clio_live_sk_...]──▶  Clio  (/api/partner/v1/*)
                         (Clio-issued partner API key)

Clio  ──[Authorization: Bearer <partner-supplied token>]──▶  Partner's backend  ({outbound_base_url}/*)
           (partner-supplied credential, configured once per partner account)
```

These are not the same credential and must never be implemented as if they were. Partner → Clio calls
authenticate against `partner_api_keys.key_hash`. Clio → partner calls authenticate using
`partner_accounts.outbound_auth_token_ciphertext` — a value the **partner** generated and handed to
Clio via a settings field (base URL + token), per brainstorm doc §7.5 point 4. Clio never issues this
credential; the partner does, exactly the reverse of the API-key direction.

## 3. API Route Map

All partner-facing routes are versioned under `/api/partner/v1/`. See
`docs/specs/B2B-02-requirement-document.md` Section 6 for full request/response Zod schemas.

### 3.1 Partner → Clio (authenticated by Clio-issued API key)

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/partner/v1/sessions` | Session-initiation contract. Topic/content reference in, `clio_session_ref` + render URL out. |
| GET | `/api/partner/v1/sessions/:clio_session_ref` | Status check on a session this key initiated. |
| GET | `/api/partner/v1/usage` | Read own usage (F-01-resolution-agnostic — see Section 7). Query params: `from`, `to`, `event_type`. |

### 3.2 Clerk-authenticated (partner-admin humans, not partner API keys)

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/admin/partner-keys` | Issue a new API key (test or live) for the caller's partner account. |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/partner-keys/:id` | Revoke a key immediately. |
| GET | `/api/admin/partner-keys` | List keys (prefix + label + last_used_at only — never the full key after issuance). |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/partner-accounts/:id/outbound-config` | Set/update `outbound_base_url`, rotate `outbound_auth_token`, regenerate `outbound_signing_secret`. |

These live under the existing internal `/api/admin/*`-style convention (see `middleware.ts`'s existing
Clerk-protected route list) — B2B-02 adds these specific routes to that protected set. No new UI is
built for them in this brief (that's B2B-03's Configurator); they exist as API endpoints only, per
Objective 6 ("UI renders what the API returns").

### 3.3 Clio → Partner (authenticated by partner-supplied token, called by Clio's own backend)

Not Clio routes — this is the contract the **partner must implement** on their own `outbound_base_url`.
Documented here as the client-side contract Clio's code will call.

| Method | Path (relative to `outbound_base_url`) | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/content` | push | Clio pushes once-generated, partner-approved content. |
| GET | `/content?content_ref=` or `?partner_topic_ref=` | pull | Clio pulls content back at render time. Zero Clio-side storage. |
| POST | `/profile` | push | Clio pushes a computed profile. Only called if `profile_sync_enabled`. |
| GET | `/profile?partner_end_user_ref=` | pull | Clio pulls a profile at session start. Only called if `profile_sync_enabled`. 404 if partner has no record yet — a fully legitimate response, not an error. |
| POST | `/webhooks/usage` | push (fire-and-forget, retried) | Signed usage/billing event. See Section 6. |

## 4. Session-Initiation Contract — Sequence

```
Partner's UI (Pluralsight button, or a No-Platform partner's Designer-built portal)
   │
   │ 1. POST /api/partner/v1/sessions
   │    Authorization: Bearer clio_live_sk_...
   │    { meeting_url, partner_topic_ref?, content_ref?, partner_end_user_ref?, partner_reference? }
   ▼
Clio: /api/partner/v1/sessions route
   │
   │ 2. Validate API key (hash lookup, status = active, mode recorded)
   │ 3. Validate request body (Zod)
   │ 4. Insert partner_sessions row → mints clio_session_ref (UUID)
   │ 5. Build renderUrl = `${APP_URL}/partner-render/${clio_session_ref}`
   │    (see Section 5 — this route is a placeholder in this brief; B2B-03 builds the real one)
   │ 6. getMeetingBotProvider().createBot(meeting_url, clio_session_ref, renderUrl)
   │    — vendor-agnostic; provider_bot_id/provider_name stored internally, never returned
   │ 7. Update partner_sessions.status = 'bot_active' (or 'bot_dispatch_failed' + error_message)
   ▼
Response: 201 { clio_session_ref, status, render_url }
   (render_url returned so a Platform Partner that wants to preview/debug can open it directly;
    the meeting-bot itself also loads it headlessly per step 6)
```

If `createBot()` throws (vendor API error, invalid meeting URL, etc.), the endpoint still returns 201
with `status: "bot_dispatch_failed"` and an `error` field — the `partner_sessions` row and
`clio_session_ref` already exist and are queryable via the status-check endpoint, rather than the whole
call failing atomically. This matches the existing codebase's per-item-error-tolerant pattern (e.g. the
old daily-delivery job's "log error, continue" convention) applied to a single-item case.

## 5. Why `partner_sessions` Is a New Table, Not a Reuse of `sessions`

**This is the one place this brief found a real integration gap and is naming it explicitly rather than
gliding over it**, per the CEO brief's own instruction to surface — not silently assume away — cases
where an assumption doesn't hold cleanly.

The legacy `sessions` table (`supabase/migrations/002_minutes_and_sessions.sql`) has `user_id TEXT NOT
NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, where `users.id` is a Clerk end-user ID. Every piece of
the currently-live meeting-bot/voice runtime — `walkthrough_tab_manifests`, `live_conductor_state`,
`session_markers` (RTV-02), position tracking (RTV-04), the minutes ledger, the quality evaluator — is
keyed to `sessions.id` and, transitively, to that Clerk `user_id`. Under the pivot, partner-initiated
sessions have no Clerk end-user identity at all (Objective 6, Non-Negotiable Data Boundary) — there is
no value that could legitimately populate that `NOT NULL` FK for a partner session.

Two options were considered:
- **(a) Relax `sessions.user_id` to nullable** and touch the dozens of existing call sites (billing,
  quality eval, RLS policies keyed on `auth.uid()::text = user_id`) to tolerate partner-originated rows.
  This is real surgery across reused, currently-live production infrastructure — squarely the kind of
  change the CEO brief's scope boundary excludes from this brief ("no Designer UI... in this spec" /
  "this brief defines the mechanism ... it does not build the routing/rendering itself" — the same
  logic that scopes B2B-05's routing out of this brief applies here to the render runtime).
- **(b) A new table** (`partner_sessions`), with its own render entry point.

This spec takes **(b)**. Consequence, stated plainly: **B2B-02's session-initiation endpoint mints a
real `clio_session_ref`, calls the real vendor-abstracted `createBot()`, and gets a real bot into the
meeting — but the URL that bot's headless browser loads (`/partner-render/[clio_session_ref]`) is a
placeholder in this brief** (per `CLAUDE.md`'s own autonomy rule: "build the minimal version... a blank
page with the route registered" when a screen's real content is a later brief's scope). The actual page
— pulling content via Section 3.3's contract, rendering it white-label, driving the Hume voice session
against it — is the point where B2B-03 (Designer/Configurator, which per `CORE_OBJECTIVES.md` §Objective
3 owns "partner-configurable rendering of reused, once-generated content") must pick this up. **This is
a named dependency for B2B-03's own Feature Brief scoping, not a gap this brief can close** — closing it
requires either wiring the render runtime to `partner_sessions` directly or bridging it to a
`sessions` row, and that's a rendering-layer decision, not a partner-API/auth decision.

Reconciling or eventually deprecating the legacy `sessions`/`users` B2C-shaped schema once the render
runtime itself is migrated is out of scope here too — flagged, not solved.

## 6. Content & Profile Push-Pull Contracts

Both contracts share an identical shape (push once, pull at render time), per the brainstorm doc's own
framing. The only difference: profile calls are gated by `partner_accounts.profile_sync_enabled`;
content calls are not gated by a toggle at all (a partner either sends `content_ref` — Clio-generated —
or `partner_topic_ref` alone — partner-authored — at session-initiation time; the pull path is identical
either way, which is what makes this "one flexible API" rather than two).

### 6.1 Content push (Clio → partner)
Triggered internally once the Designer approval flow (B2B-03, not built here) marks a generated content
item approved. Contract only — the trigger itself belongs to B2B-03.

```json
POST {outbound_base_url}/content
Authorization: Bearer {partner-supplied token}

{
  "content_ref": "c5e2f1a0-...-uuid",     // Clio-minted
  "partner_topic_ref": "string",           // partner's own identifier, echoed back
  "format": "html" | "json",
  "payload": "<the actual content>",
  "version": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-07-13T18:00:00Z"
}
```
Expected response: `2xx` = stored. Any other response is surfaced synchronously to whatever internal
caller triggered the push (e.g. the Designer's "approve" action) — **never retried via
`webhook_dispatch_log`** (see Section 7's scope boundary on what that table may hold).

### 6.2 Content pull (Clio → partner, at render time)
```
GET {outbound_base_url}/content?content_ref=c5e2f1a0-...   (Clio-generated case)
GET {outbound_base_url}/content?partner_topic_ref=string    (partner-authored case)
Authorization: Bearer {partner-supplied token}
```
Response: same shape as the push body, or `404` (Clio surfaces this to the render layer as "no content
available," a legitimate, handled state — not an error page).

**Zero Clio-side persistence**: the `payload` field is never written to any Clio table in either
direction. It exists only in-memory for the duration of the HTTP request/response cycle that consumes
it.

### 6.3 Profile push / pull (Clio → partner)
Identical shape, keyed by `partner_end_user_ref` instead of `content_ref`/`partner_topic_ref`:
```json
POST {outbound_base_url}/profile
{ "partner_end_user_ref": "string", "profile": { "knowledge": {}, "intellectual": {}, "psychological": {}, "business_lens": {} }, "computed_at": "..." }

GET {outbound_base_url}/profile?partner_end_user_ref=string
→ 200 { ...same shape... }  or  404 (no profile yet — first session, fully legitimate)
```
Only called at all if `partner_accounts.profile_sync_enabled = true`. If `false`, this code path is
never invoked — not called-and-ignored, **never invoked** — this is what makes Objective 1's falsifiable
test ("toggle off ⇒ Clio has no memory of the user") actually verifiable: there is no code path that
could produce cross-session memory when the toggle is off, because the only mechanism that could ever
supply it (this pull call) never executes.

## 7. Usage-Metering & Signed Webhook Mechanism

### 7.1 What triggers an event
Three event types dispatch through this mechanism — two billable, matching the CEO brief's "What
Success Looks Like" item 5 exactly, plus one non-billable lifecycle event:
- `usage.voice_minute` — emitted by whatever existing code marks a partner session's meeting-bot time
  (the natural integration point is the same code path that today calls `deduct_minutes`/writes
  `minutes_ledger` for B2C sessions — for partner sessions, the equivalent write targets
  `webhook_dispatch_log` [+ `usage_events` if F-01 resolves to Resolution A] instead, keyed to
  `partner_sessions.id`, not a Clerk `user_id`).
- `usage.llm_generation_call` — emitted at each topic/content/prerequisite generation call, with a
  `generation_type` field distinguishing which.
- `session.completed` — **not billable**, `quantity`/`unit`/`generation_type` are `null`/irrelevant on
  this event type. Fired once when `partner_sessions.status` transitions to `completed`, so a partner
  can close out their own session record (e.g. mark it done on their dashboard) without having to poll
  `GET /api/partner/v1/sessions/:ref`. Included because it is zero marginal cost on top of the
  voice-minute dispatch that already fires at session end, and closes an obvious partner-side polling
  gap — not named explicitly in the Feature Brief's success criteria, so treated as a small in-scope
  convenience rather than a new capability requiring its own justification.

Building the actual call-site instrumentation into the (not-yet-built) B2B-03 Designer generation
pipeline is out of this brief's scope — this brief defines the event contract and delivery mechanism
those future call sites will emit into.

### 7.2 Dispatch flow
```
Billable event occurs
   │
   │ 1. Insert webhook_dispatch_log row (status='pending', payload + payload_hash + HMAC signature computed)
   │    [+ insert usage_events row, if F-01 Resolution A is in effect — Section 8]
   ▼
Inngest function: webhook-dispatcher (new, this brief)
   │
   │ 2. POST {outbound_base_url}/webhooks/usage
   │    Headers: Clio-Signature: t=<unix_ts>,v1=<hmac_hex>
   │            (mirrors Stripe's header format; hex = HMAC-SHA256(signing_secret, `${t}.${raw_body}`))
   │ 3. On 2xx: delivery_status='delivered', delivered_at=now()
   │ 4. On non-2xx or timeout: retry_count++, delivery_status stays 'pending',
   │    next_retry_at = now() + backoff(retry_count)
   │    Backoff schedule: 1m, 5m, 30m, 2h, 6h (5 attempts total)
   │ 5. After 5 failed attempts: delivery_status='exhausted' — surfaced on the future
   │    partner dashboard (B2B-04) as "N undelivered events," recoverable via
   │    GET /api/partner/v1/usage (Section 3.1), which reads independent of delivery_status
   ▼
Partner's /webhooks/usage endpoint
   │ Verifies Clio-Signature the same way Clio's own Stripe/Clerk webhook
   │ handlers verify inbound signatures (HMAC recompute + constant-time
   │ compare + timestamp tolerance window of 5 minutes, rejecting anything
   │ older — replay protection, per the Feature Brief's explicit requirement)
```

### 7.3 Webhook payload — exact shape
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_type": "usage.voice_minute" | "usage.llm_generation_call" | "session.completed",
  "clio_session_ref": "uuid | null",
  "partner_reference": "string | null",
  "quantity": 1.5 | null,          // null for session.completed (not billable)
  "unit": "minutes" | "calls" | null,
  "generation_type": "topic" | "content" | "prerequisite" | null,
  "occurred_at": "ISO8601",
  "dispatched_at": "ISO8601"
}
```
Notice what is **not** in this payload: no end-user identity, no content, no profile data. This shape is
identical regardless of which way F-01 resolves (see Section 8) — the fork, if any, is entirely
internal to how Clio computes/stores its own read-side numbers, never in what the partner receives.

### 7.4 What must never be logged
`webhook_dispatch_log.payload` is constrained (by the event_type CHECK constraint and by convention) to
the shape in 7.3 only. The content-push/pull and profile-push/pull calls (Section 6) are **never**
written to `webhook_dispatch_log` or any other table — they are synchronous, ephemeral, and their
failure is surfaced directly to the calling code path, not queued for retry via this log. This is a
deliberate boundary, not an oversight: allowing content/profile bodies into an audit-log table would
create exactly the kind of Clio-side persistence Objective 6 and the Non-Negotiable Data Boundary
prohibit.

## 8. F-01 Handling — Two Branches, Neither Blocking This Brief

Per the CEO brief's explicit instruction, this brief does not resolve F-01 (does Clio keep its own
opaque-reference usage ledger, or compute billing/dashboard numbers live via round-trips to partner
APIs). Both branches are spec'd concretely enough for B2B-04 to pick either without reopening this
document:

**Resolution A — opaque-reference ledger.** `usage_events` (migration
`072_b2b02_usage_events_resolution_a.sql`) is inserted alongside every `webhook_dispatch_log` write.
B2B-04's admin page and partner dashboard `SUM(quantity) ... GROUP BY partner_account_id, event_type`
over this table, filtering `test_mode = FALSE`.

**Resolution B — zero storage, live round-trip.** Migration 072 is never applied. B2B-04's dashboards
either (a) call back into the partner's own API for numbers the partner already tracks, or (b) compute
aggregates at read time directly from `webhook_dispatch_log.payload` (a `GROUP BY` over JSONB fields —
more expensive per query, no separate table, still zero *additional* Clio-side storage beyond the
F-01-independent dispatch log that exists regardless).

**Finding on whether the partner-facing contract forks**: it does not. Section 7.3's webhook payload
shape, the `/api/partner/v1/usage` read endpoint's response shape, and every partner-facing route in
Section 3 are byte-for-byte identical under either resolution. The only thing that changes is the SQL
`GET /api/partner/v1/usage` runs internally to answer the query. This confirms the CEO brief's own
working belief (not certain, but correct) — no escalation triggered.

## 9. Sub-Tenant Delegation — Confirmed: No New Identity Concept, With One Named Exception

Per `CORE_OBJECTIVES.md` and the CEO brief's working conclusion: Clio never stores a sub-tenant table,
never issues sub-tenant-scoped API keys, and never resolves `partner_reference` to any real identity.
The base case holds cleanly: because the top-level partner (Capgemini) is the one who calls
`/api/partner/v1/sessions` on Hartford's behalf (Hartford's employees never touch Clio directly),
Capgemini already receives `clio_session_ref` synchronously in the initiation response and can maintain
its own `{clio_session_ref: hartford_employee_id}` mapping entirely on its own side — Clio does not need
to store or understand anything about Hartford for this to work.

**The one case where a bare opaque reference isn't quite enough, exactly as the CEO brief anticipated**:
without any passthrough field at all, Capgemini's only correlation key on incoming usage webhooks is
`clio_session_ref` — meaning every webhook consumer on Capgemini's side has to already know, from its
own records, which session belongs to which sub-tenant. That's *workable* but pushes 100% of the
correlation burden onto Capgemini maintaining a perfect session-ref-to-sub-tenant map with no
convenience from Clio's side. `partner_reference` (present on `partner_sessions`,
`webhook_dispatch_log`, and `usage_events`) closes that gap as a pure convenience: Capgemini may
optionally pass an opaque tag (e.g. `"hartford"`, or their own internal sub-tenant ID) at
session-initiation time, and Clio echoes it verbatim on every subsequent usage webhook for that session
— without Clio ever interpreting, indexing meaningfully, validating the format of, or exposing it to
any Clio-side UI beyond raw pass-through storage. This does not introduce a new identity concept (Clio
still sees only a rollup line per top-level `partner_account_id` in every aggregate query in Section 8)
— it is a convenience field, not a schema change to how Clio thinks about tenancy.

## 10. Rate Limiting & Key Rotation (technical judgment calls, per Feature Brief delegation)

**Rate limiting** (per `partner_account_id`, token-bucket, technical decision within BA authority):
- `POST /api/partner/v1/sessions`: 60 requests/min (guards against a runaway partner-side loop spinning
  up bot sessions)
- `GET /api/partner/v1/sessions/:ref`, `GET /api/partner/v1/usage`: 300 requests/min
- `429` response includes `Retry-After` header. Limits are a hardcoded default in this brief (a column
  on `partner_accounts` for per-partner override is a natural extension point for B2B-04's enterprise
  tiers, not built here — noted as a future column, not added speculatively now).

**Key rotation/revocation UX** (technical decision within BA authority):
- A partner account may have any number of `active` keys per `mode` simultaneously — generating a new
  key does not invalidate existing ones. This enables zero-downtime rotation: generate new, migrate
  traffic, then revoke old.
- Revocation (`DELETE /api/admin/partner-keys/:id`, Clerk-authenticated) is immediate and
  uncached — every `/api/partner/v1/*` request does a direct `key_hash` lookup against
  `partner_api_keys.status = 'active'` (no revocation-propagation delay to reason about, at the cost of
  one indexed lookup per request, which is cheap and matches the existing lookup-per-request pattern
  used elsewhere in this codebase, e.g. Clerk session validation).
- No automatic expiry — keys remain valid until explicitly revoked. Automatic expiry policies (e.g.
  "unused keys auto-revoke after 90 days") are a reasonable future enhancement, not built here (not
  named in the Feature Brief's success criteria).

## 11. Meeting-Bot Vendor Abstraction — Respected, Not Bypassed

`getMeetingBotProvider()` (`lib/meeting-bot/provider.ts`) is called as-is from the new
`/api/partner/v1/sessions` route, exactly as it's called today from `inngest/session-meeting-setup.ts`
and `app/api/admin/test-session/route.ts`. Verified against the actual provider implementations
(`lib/meeting-bot/attendee.ts`, `lib/meeting-bot/recall.ts`): the `userId` parameter of `createBot()` is
used only as opaque bot metadata/a deduplication-key seed, never as an enforced Clerk-identity check —
confirming it is safe to pass `clio_session_ref` in that parameter's place without any change to
`MeetingBotProvider`'s interface. No response from `/api/partner/v1/sessions` ever includes
`provider_bot_id` or `provider_name` — the partner-facing contract has zero vendor-identifying surface,
satisfying the constraint that the Recall→Attendee migration (V-02, still mid-flight per
`docs/b2b-pivot-status.md`) must not leak through this brief's API.

## 12. B2B-03 — Designer/Configurator (new)

Version: 1.0 | Produced by: Business Analyst Agent, as part of B2B-03
Source Feature Brief: `.claude/agents/clio/feature-briefs/B2B-03-designer-configurator.md`
Requirement Document: `docs/specs/B2B-03-requirement-document.md`

Extends Sections 1–11 above (B2B-02), does not replace them. Requirement-level rationale lives in the
Requirement Document; this section is the exact schema/route/sequence detail a developer implements
against, per the same division of labor B2B-02 established.

### 12.1 New Tables (all partner-scoped from creation — see Requirement Document Section 6.4 for the
isolation mechanism these tables share)

```sql
-- Questionnaire authoring (definition only — submissions are never persisted, see 12.3)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partner_questionnaires (
  id                  UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  partner_account_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES partner_accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status              TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'published')),
  layout              TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'single_page' CHECK (layout IN ('single_page', 'multi_page')),
  schema              JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb, -- [{id, text, type, options?, required}]
  created_at          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_partner_questionnaires_account ON partner_questionnaires(partner_account_id);
-- Enforced in application code, not a DB constraint (requires a transactional "set target published,
-- set siblings back to draft" write, not expressible as a single-column unique-partial-index without
-- a race window): at most one 'published' row per partner_account_id.

-- Thin audit-only log for questionnaire submission delivery — deliberately NO payload column.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS questionnaire_dispatch_log (
  id                  UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  partner_account_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES partner_accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  submitted_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  delivery_status     TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (delivery_status IN ('delivered', 'failed')),
  http_status_code    INTEGER
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_questionnaire_dispatch_log_account ON questionnaire_dispatch_log(partner_account_id, submitted_at DESC);

-- Topics/prerequisites source toggles (two independent columns, per Requirement Doc Section 6.2)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partner_topic_config (
  id                    UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  partner_account_id    UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES partner_accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  topics_source         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'clio_generated' CHECK (topics_source IN ('clio_generated', 'partner_supplied')),
  prerequisites_source  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'clio_generated' CHECK (prerequisites_source IN ('clio_generated', 'partner_supplied')),
  updated_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Content generation staging — transient, never a permanent content store (see 12.3 / draft_payload lifecycle)

### 12.2 API Route Map (Clerk-authenticated, `/api/admin/configurator/*` — added to `middleware.ts`'s
protected set alongside the existing `/api/admin/partner-keys*`)

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET/PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/questionnaire` | List/create/edit draft questionnaires; `POST .../publish` enforces single-published invariant |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/topics-config` | Read/update `partner_topic_config`'s two toggles |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/content-config` | Read/update content-source toggle |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/content/generate` | Trigger `generatePartnerContent(partnerAccountId, partnerTopicRef)` |
| GET | `/api/admin/configurator/content/:id` | Poll a `partner_content_items` row's status |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/content/:id/approve` | Push via `pushPartnerContent()`, mint `content_ref`, null `draft_payload` |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/content/:id/reject` | Null `draft_payload`, set `status='rejected'` |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/theme` | Level A read/write |
| GET | `/api/admin/configurator/templates` | List `template_library` rows with `status='approved'`, joined with this partner's `partner_template_config` |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/templates/:templateName` | Level B read/write; `409 template_not_approved` if not RTV-04-approved |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/templates/:templateName/components/:slot` | Level C read/write |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/templates/:templateName/sample-fill` | Ephemeral AI preview fill, fires `usage_events` |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/templates/discover` | Free-text matching (Requirement Doc Section 6.5's scoring function) |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/templates/generate-new` | Net-new skeleton generation (Requirement Doc Section 6.4, Section 11 Q1); validates output against the schema-safety boundary before persisting; on success inserts `partner_custom_templates` (`status='pending_review'`) and fires `usage_events` (`llm_generation_new_template`); on safety-validation failure, persists nothing and fires no `usage_events` row |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/templates/custom/:id/confirm` | Partner-admin's explicit `[Confirm & make live]` click; sets `status='live'`, `confirmed_at=now()`; no Clio-side check |
| GET | `/api/admin/configurator/preference-meter` | Read `partner_design_preference` |

Every route above takes `partner_account_id` explicitly (body for POST/PATCH, query param for GET) and
calls `requirePartnerAdmin(partnerAccountId)` (`lib/partner/auth.ts`, unmodified) before any DB access —
per the Requirement Document's Section 6.4 isolation mechanism.

**Public, no auth:**

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/partner-questionnaire/[partner_account_id]` | Renders the partner's `published` questionnaire |
| POST | `/partner-questionnaire/[partner_account_id]/submit` | Forwards synchronously to `{outbound_base_url}/questionnaire-response`, never persisted (12.3) |
| GET | `/partner-render/[clio_session_ref]` | Replaces the B2B-02 placeholder — full sequence in 12.6 |

### 12.3 Questionnaire Submission — Synchronous Forward, Never Persisted

```
End user submits → POST /partner-questionnaire/[partner_account_id]/submit
  → POST {outbound_base_url}/questionnaire-response (partner token, same auth as /content)
  → 2xx: INSERT questionnaire_dispatch_log (delivered, http_status_code) → 200 to end user (Screen state 3)
  → non-2xx/timeout: INSERT questionnaire_dispatch_log (failed, http_status_code) → error to end user (Screen state 4)
```
The answer payload itself exists only in the request body of the outbound call — never written to any
Clio table, matching architecture.md Section 6.2's "zero Clio-side persistence" discipline for content,
extended here to questionnaire submissions for the same reason.

### 12.4 `partner_content_items.draft_payload` Lifecycle

```
generatePartnerContent() called → INSERT partner_content_items (status='generating', draft_payload=NULL)
  → pipeline completes → UPDATE draft_payload = {...}, status = 'ready_for_review'
  → partner reviews (Configurator Screen state 3) →
      [Approve] → pushPartnerContent() → 2xx → UPDATE content_ref = <minted>, draft_payload = NULL, status = 'approved'
      [Reject]  → UPDATE draft_payload = NULL, status = 'rejected'
  → Inngest cron (daily): DELETE FROM partner_content_items WHERE expires_at < now() AND status NOT IN ('approved') 
    -- approved rows keep their (already-NULL-payload) row as a lightweight historical index only
```

### 12.5 Component Slot Sets Per Template (Level C)

Derived directly from each template's existing `*Data` interface in `lib/templates/types.ts`, the same
method RTV-04 used to describe all 23 pre-existing templates against their confirmed schemas. Non-exhaustive
examples (full list generated programmatically from the type definitions at build time, not hand-maintained):
`Heatmap` → `cell`, `legend`; `Overlay` → `zone_marker`, `connector`, `callout_card`; `ComparisonTable` →
`row`, `column_header`, `cell`; `Flowchart`/`HorizontalDecision` → `node`, `edge`; `StepFlow`/
`ChevronProcess` → `step_card`, `connector`; every template with a `so_what` field also gets an implicit
`footer` slot (maps to `show_so_what_footer` at Level B, not a separate Level C slot, since it is a
boolean toggle, not a styleable component).

### 12.6 Live-Session Render Path — Full Sequence

```
Meeting-bot headless browser loads /partner-render/[clio_session_ref]
  │
  │ 1. SELECT * FROM partner_sessions WHERE id = clio_session_ref (existing logic, unchanged)
  │ 2. pullPartnerContent(partnerAccountId, {contentRef, partnerTopicRef}) [existing, tested]
  │ 3. IF profile_sync_enabled: pullPartnerProfile(partnerAccountId, partnerEndUserRef) [existing, tested]
  │ 4. FOR EACH content section: resolvePartnerTheme(partnerAccountId, templateName) [new]
  │      → merges partner_theme_config (Level A, always) + partner_template_config (Level B, if row exists)
  │        + partner_component_config (Level C, if rows exist) → CSS custom properties, Clio defaults as
  │        the `var(--x, default)` fallback for any unset level
  │ 5. selectTemplate(subtopicTitle, position, templateHint) [existing, pure, unmodified] → templateName
  │ 6. <TemplateRenderer> [existing component] wrapped in <style>{cssCustomProperties}</style>
  │ 7. buildHumeNativeConfig() [lib/voice/hume-native/config-provisioner.ts + prompt-template.ts, reused]
  │      injects: pulled content's coaching_narrative/script segments, pulled profile (if available),
  │      partner_theme_config.assistant_display_name ?? "your AI guide" in place of "Clio"
  │ 8. Session proceeds (existing Hume-native runtime, reused as-is)
  │ 9. On end: UPDATE partner_sessions SET status='completed', ended_at=now() [new call site, this brief]
  │      → fires usage.voice_minute + session.completed via the existing B2B-02 webhook-dispatcher
  ▼
End user sees a fully white-labeled, partner-themed session with zero Clio branding
```

**Known gap, flagged not assumed**: step 5's `selectTemplate()` currently resolves only against
`template_library` (RTV-04-approved base templates). The Section 11 Q1 resolution establishes that a
`partner_custom_templates` row with `status='live'` must be eligible to render (Requirement Doc Section
7's acceptance test), but does not specify *how* a live custom template enters `selectTemplate()`'s
candidate pool for a given content section — that integration (e.g. an extra lookup keyed on
`partner_account_id` before or alongside the `template_library` hint match) is real design work this
resolution did not cover and this document does not invent. Needs a short follow-up design pass before
`generate-new`/`confirm` are wired to an actual live render, not before the Configurator-side
generate → preview → confirm flow itself (which is fully specified and does not depend on this).

## 13. B2B-04 — Billing / Metering (new)

Version: 1.0 | Produced by: Business Analyst Agent, as part of B2B-04
Source Feature Brief: `.claude/agents/clio/feature-briefs/B2B-04-billing-metering.md`
Requirement Document: `docs/specs/B2B-04-requirement-document.md`
Migration: `supabase/migrations/075_b2b04_billing_metering.sql`

Extends Sections 1–12 above, does not replace them. Rationale for every decision below lives in the
Requirement Document (especially its Section 6, "Data Requirements") — this section is the exact

### 13.2 API Route Map

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/billing/clients` | Clerk (matches `/dashboard/admin/templates`'s boundary) | Backs the `/dashboard/admin/clients` screen — cross-partner billing/health rollup. |
| GET | `/dashboard/admin/clients` | Clerk | The one real UI screen this brief builds. |
| POST | `/api/admin/billing/checkout` | Clerk, `requirePartnerAdmin` | Self-serve wallet top-up — Stripe Checkout, `mode: "payment"`. |
| POST | `/api/admin/billing/subscription` | Clerk, `requirePartnerAdmin` | Mid-market auto-recharge — Stripe Checkout, `mode: "subscription"`. |
| POST | `/api/admin/billing/invoice` | Clerk, internal-operator (same boundary as `/api/admin/billing/clients`) | Enterprise invoicing — Stripe Invoicing. |
| GET | `/api/partner/v1/wallet` | Partner API key, `requirePartnerApiKey(..., 'reads')` | New sibling to `GET /api/partner/v1/usage` — balance/burn-rate/days-remaining, own data only. |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/stripe` | Stripe signature (`constructWebhookEvent`, reused unmodified) | Reworked (not extended) — see 13.3. Handles `checkout.session.completed` (topup), `invoice.paid` (mid-market recharge), `invoice.payment_succeeded` (enterprise), `customer.updated`/`payment_method.attached` (payment-method cache sync). |

Every `/api/admin/billing/*` route lives under the existing internal `/api/admin/*` convention already
protected by `middleware.ts`'s Clerk gate — no `middleware.ts` change needed beyond confirming these new
paths fall under the existing non-public catch-all (they do; only explicitly-listed routes are public).

### 13.3 `lib/partner/webhooks.ts` — Exact Fix

`recordBillableEvent()`'s `webhook_dispatch_log` upsert already uses
`{ onConflict: 'partner_account_id,event_type,clio_session_ref,payload_hash', ignoreDuplicates: true }`
and reads the result via `.select('id').maybeSingle()` — on a duplicate-ignored conflict, `inserted` is
`null`. Today, the subsequent `usage_events` insert runs regardless of whether `inserted` is `null`. The
fix: guard that entire block (and the wallet-decrement call this brief adds after it) behind
`if (inserted?.id) { ... }` — on a duplicate (`inserted` is `null`), skip both the `usage_events` insert
and `applyWalletDecrement()` entirely, and return the **existing** dispatch-log row's id (a lookup by the
same conflict key) rather than an empty string, so the function's return contract stays meaningful on a
duplicate call.

New function, same file: `applyWalletDecrement(usageEventId, partnerAccountId, eventType, quantity,
occurredAt, testMode)` — implements the exact sequence in Requirement Doc Section 5.B.1. Called from
`recordBillableEvent()` immediately after a genuinely-new `usage_events` insert succeeds (for billable
`eventType`s only, never `session.completed`).

### 13.4 `lib/stripe.ts` — Rework, Not Extension

Removed (B2C-era, do not survive): `getPlanFromPriceId`, `createCheckoutSession` (flat-plan
subscription), `createSubscriptionIntent` (fixed 3-day-trial flow). **Retained as-is**: `stripeClient`
initialization + `isPlaceholder` guard convention, `constructWebhookEvent` (explicitly named reusable
infrastructure by the Feature Brief), `createPortalSession` (repurposed for partner card-on-file
self-service via the Stripe Customer Portal — its signature already only takes a `customerId`, no B2C
assumption baked in, so it needs no change).

New functions, all following the existing `isPlaceholder`-guarded mock-log pattern:
- `createWalletTopupCheckoutSession(partnerAccountId, amountUsd, successUrl?, cancelUrl?)` — `mode:
  "payment"`, ad-hoc `price_data` line item (no pre-created Stripe Price object needed), `metadata: {
  partner_account_id, purpose: "wallet_topup" }`.
- `createAutoRechargeSubscriptionCheckout(partnerAccountId, monthlyMinimumUsd, successUrl?, cancelUrl?)`
  — `mode: "subscription"`, ad-hoc recurring `price_data` (`recurring: { interval: "month" }`),
  `metadata: { partner_account_id, purpose: "wallet_auto_recharge" }`.
- `createEnterpriseInvoice(partnerAccountId, amountUsd, stripeCustomerId, description,
  collectionMethod)` — `invoiceItems.create` + `invoices.create({ collection_method })` +
  `invoices.finalizeInvoice` + (`collection_method === 'send_invoice'` ? `invoices.sendInvoice` : implicit
  auto-charge), `metadata: { partner_account_id, purpose: "wallet_invoice" }`.
- `getOrCreateStripeCustomer(partnerAccountId, billingEmail?)` — finds an existing
  `partner_wallets.stripe_customer_id` or creates one, `metadata: { partner_account_id }`.

`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` is reworked to add handling for `checkout.session.completed` (branch
on `session.metadata.purpose`), `invoice.paid`/`invoice.payment_succeeded` (branch on
`invoice.subscription` presence per Requirement Doc 5.B.3 vs 5.B.4), and `customer.updated` /
`payment_method.attached` (sync `payment_method_card_brand`/`last4`/`type` onto `partner_wallets` so the
admin page never needs a live per-row Stripe API call). The existing B2C-era branches
(`customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted` keyed to `users.id`, the old `topup`-metadata `minutes`
branch, Twilio SMS send) are dead code once B2C is retired but are **not** removed as part of this brief
— removing them is a separate cleanup, out of this brief's scope (Requirement Doc Section 10 lists only
this brief's own exclusions; the B2C branches predate this brief and their removal is tracked
separately, not silently done here to avoid conflating two unrelated changes in one migration).

### 13.5 `avg_daily_burn_usd` / `projected_days_remaining` — exact formula

*(Added in Requirement Doc v1.1, closing a CEO-review gap. Computed live, at request time, by
`GET /api/admin/billing/clients` and `GET /api/partner/v1/wallet` — this is a single indexed
aggregate query per partner over `usage_events`, not an external API call, so it does not need the
"cache and never live-fetch" treatment `next_billing_date` gets for Stripe-sourced fields (13.1) —
there is no cache-invalidation problem to solve and live computation is simpler and always current.)*

**Window: trailing 7 complete UTC calendar days, current partial day always excluded.**

```
window_end   = date_trunc('day', NOW())              -- UTC midnight, start of "today"
window_start = window_end - INTERVAL '7 days'
```

Why 7 days, not 30: this number feeds an admin's "is this account about to run dry" judgment, not a
financial report. A 30-day average would smooth over a partner ramping usage sharply in the last few
days — exactly the case where the admin most needs the number to move quickly — and would keep
showing a comfortable `projected_days_remaining` while an account is actually burning through its
balance far faster than the smoothed average suggests. A 1-day window would be too noisy (one unusually
heavy or light day swings the whole number). 7 days catches a real week-over-week trend shift while a
single outlier day still only moves the average by ~1/7th.

Why the current partial day is excluded entirely, not prorated: prorating (`today's spend so far ÷
hours elapsed today × 24`) requires assuming usage accrues at a constant rate through the day, which is
not a safe assumption for this product (voice-minute usage clusters around scheduled sessions, not
evenly across 24 hours) — prorating a partial morning spike is exactly the "$50 in 3 hours ≠ $50/day"
overstatement this formula must not produce. Excluding today entirely means the number is always based
on 7 fully-observed days; it updates once, at UTC midnight, when "today" rolls into the window as a
complete day.

**New-account handling (a wallet with less than 7 complete days of history):**

```
account_start = date_trunc('day', partner_wallets.created_at)
effective_start = GREATEST(window_start, account_start)
days_in_window = (window_end - effective_start) in whole days   -- 0..7
```

If `days_in_window = 0` (wallet created today, no complete day has passed yet), there is no window to
average over at all — treated identically to "no billed usage," below (`no_burn_rate`). This is
correct, not a special case requiring different handling: a day-0 account and a 7-day-old account with
zero usage both mean "not enough signal to project," which is exactly what `no_burn_rate` communicates.

**Aggregation: simple arithmetic mean over calendar days in the window, including zero-usage days.**

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount_usd), 0) AS window_total_usd
FROM usage_events
WHERE partner_account_id = $1
  AND billed = true
  AND occurred_at >= effective_start
  AND occurred_at <  window_end;

avg_daily_burn_usd =
  CASE WHEN days_in_window = 0 OR window_total_usd = 0
       THEN NULL
       ELSE window_total_usd / days_in_window
  END
```

A simple mean, not a weighted or exponentially-decayed one: the window is already short (7 days) and
already excludes the noisiest input (today), so a further weighting scheme would add complexity without
a clear admin-facing benefit — this is a "warn me before it's a problem" number, not a forecasting
model. Divide by `days_in_window` (calendar days elapsed), never by "days that had any usage" — a
partner idle for 4 of the last 7 days genuinely has a lower daily burn rate than one who used the same
total in 3 days, and the average must reflect that, not paper over the idle days.

**`projected_days_remaining` — derived from `avg_daily_burn_usd` and `balance_usd`, with an explicit
null-reason field (closes the sort tie-break gap, Section 13.6):**

```
IF avg_daily_burn_usd IS NULL               -- no complete day in window, or zero billed usage in it
  → projected_days_remaining = NULL
  → days_remaining_null_reason = 'no_burn_rate'
ELSE IF balance_usd <= 0                    -- already exhausted or negative
  → projected_days_remaining = NULL
  → days_remaining_null_reason = 'exhausted_balance'
ELSE
  → projected_days_remaining = balance_usd / avg_daily_burn_usd
  → days_remaining_null_reason = NULL
```

`days_remaining_null_reason` is a new response field (not a DB column — computed at read time
alongside `avg_daily_burn_usd`/`projected_days_remaining`, all three ephemeral, never persisted) on
both `GET /api/admin/billing/clients` (Requirement Doc 4.B.1) and `GET /api/partner/v1/wallet`
(Requirement Doc 4.B.2): `"days_remaining_null_reason": "exhausted_balance" | "no_burn_rate" | null`.
It exists so every consumer of these two endpoints (the admin page today, a future partner-built
dashboard tomorrow per Objective 6) gets an explicit, pre-resolved signal instead of each one
re-deriving "which kind of null is this" from `balance_usd`/`avg_daily_burn_usd` independently and
risking two different, silently inconsistent implementations of the same distinction.

### 13.6 Admin page sort comparator — `days_remaining` column, both directions

*(Added in Requirement Doc v1.1, closing a CEO-review gap.)* The two null cases are not
interchangeable and must never collapse into "sorts as if 0" or "sorts as if last" via a generic
nulls-first/nulls-last rule — `exhausted_balance` is the most urgent state (sorts first ascending),
`no_burn_rate` is the least urgent (sorts last ascending), and a naive `ORDER BY projected_days_remaining
ASC NULLS LAST` would group both null reasons together and lose that distinction entirely.

**Implementation: map every row to a single synthetic numeric sort key, then run one ordinary numeric
sort (ascending or descending) on that key. Both directions reuse the exact same key — there is no
separate "descending" branch of logic to drift out of sync with ascending.**

```ts
function sortKey(row: { projected_days_remaining: number | null; days_remaining_null_reason: 'exhausted_balance' | 'no_burn_rate' | null }): number {
  if (row.days_remaining_null_reason === 'exhausted_balance') return -Infinity;
  if (row.days_remaining_null_reason === 'no_burn_rate') return Infinity;
  return row.projected_days_remaining as number; // finite, real value
}

function sortByDaysRemaining(rows, direction: 'asc' | 'desc') {
  const withKeys = rows.map(r => ({ row: r, key: sortKey(r), name: r.name }));
  withKeys.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.key !== b.key) return direction === 'asc' ? a.key - b.key : b.key - a.key;
    return a.name.localeCompare(b.name); // deterministic secondary key, same for both directions
  });
  return withKeys.map(w => w.row);
}
```

Why `-Infinity` / `+Infinity` rather than e.g. `-1` / `999999`: an exhausted-balance account is
conceptually "0 or negative days left" — the true minimum of the domain — and a no-burn-rate account is
conceptually "runway of unknown/unbounded length at the current (zero-signal) rate" — the true maximum.
Using signed infinities makes both directions of the *same* comparator produce the semantically correct
order for free: ascending (fewest days left first) naturally yields `exhausted_balance → finite ascending
→ no_burn_rate`; descending (most days left first) naturally yields `no_burn_rate → finite descending →
exhausted_balance`. Clicking the "Days remaining" column header to toggle ascending/descending calls
`sortByDaysRemaining` with the flipped `direction` argument — **it reuses this exact function, not a
separate re-sort path** — so the two null meanings never scramble together regardless of which direction
the admin has toggled to. This is also why a bare `Array.prototype.sort` on the raw
`projected_days_remaining` field (which would coerce both `null`s to the same JS sort behavior) must
never be used directly against this column; `sortKey()` is the only permitted comparator input for it.

Secondary tie-break (`name.localeCompare`, ascending, always — not reversed by `direction`): ties within
the two infinity tiers (e.g. two accounts that both have `exhausted_balance`) need *some* deterministic
order so the table doesn't visibly reshuffle on every re-render; alphabetical by partner name is
arbitrary but stable, which is all that's required here — no product meaning is implied by it.

## 14. B2B-05 — Domain / White-label Infrastructure (new)

Version: 1.2 | Produced by: Business Analyst Agent, as part of B2B-05
Source Feature Brief: `.claude/agents/clio/feature-briefs/B2B-05-domain-whitelabel-infra.md`
Requirement Document: `docs/specs/B2B-05-requirement-document.md`
v1.2 note: §14.7.5 corrected — the `embedded` prop fix for `QuestionnaireBuilderClient` and
`ContentConfigClient` is two independent per-branch insertions, not one; see §14.7.5 and the Requirement
Document's v1.2 changelog for the full correction and rationale.

Extends Sections 1–13 above, does not replace them. Requirement-level rationale (screen states, exact
copy, acceptance tests) lives in the Requirement Document; this section is the exact schema/route/
middleware detail a developer implements against, per the same division of labor B2B-02/03/04 established.

### 14.1 Environment Variables (new)

```
CLIO_ROOT_DOMAIN=hello-clio.com          # single config value — see Requirement Doc Section 9
VERCEL_API_TOKEN=PLACEHOLDER_VERCEL_API_TOKEN
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=PLACEHOLDER_VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
VERCEL_TEAM_ID=PLACEHOLDER_VERCEL_TEAM_ID   # optional; only required if the project is team-scoped
```
`CLIO_ROOT_DOMAIN` is server-side only (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) — the Configurator screen gets it via
`GET /api/admin/configurator/domain`'s `root_domain` field (Requirement Doc Section 4.B.1), never a
duplicated client-side env var, so there is exactly one source of truth.

### 14.2 Schema (migration, additive ALTER only — no new tables)

```sql
-- B2B-05: subdomain-first + custom-domain white-label infrastructure.
-- Additive only — no existing partner_accounts column is modified or dropped.

ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subdomain_slug TEXT;
ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_domain TEXT;
ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_domain_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'none'
  CHECK (custom_domain_status IN ('none', 'pending_verification', 'verified', 'failed'));
ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_domain_error TEXT;
ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_domain_verification JSONB;
ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_domain_added_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS custom_domain_verified_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_partner_accounts_subdomain_slug
  ON partner_accounts (subdomain_slug) WHERE subdomain_slug IS NOT NULL;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_partner_accounts_custom_domain
  ON partner_accounts (custom_domain) WHERE custom_domain IS NOT NULL;

COMMENT ON COLUMN partner_accounts.subdomain_slug IS 'B2B-05: lowercase DNS label, unique, resolves {slug}.{CLIO_ROOT_DOMAIN} to this partner.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN partner_accounts.custom_domain IS 'B2B-05: lowercase hostname, unique, registered via Vercel Domains API. NULL until custom_domain_status leaves ''none''.';
```

Both new unique indexes are the mechanism that makes cross-partner domain leakage structurally
impossible (Requirement Doc Section 7's isolation acceptance test) — a second `PATCH`/`POST` attempting
to claim an already-used value fails at the DB layer even if application-level validation were ever
bypassed.

**Reserved subdomain-slug list** (`lib/partner/domain-config.ts`, exact array — not invented ad hoc
per-call, a single exported constant):
```ts
export const RESERVED_SUBDOMAIN_SLUGS = [
  'www', 'api', 'app', 'admin', 'dashboard', 'sign-in', 'sign-up', 'pricing', 'onboarding', 'plan',
  'checkout', 'topics', 'walkthrough', 'partner-render', 'partner-questionnaire', 'questionnaire',
  'mail', 'ftp', 'staging', 'dev', 'test', 'docs', 'status', 'blog', 'cdn', 'static', 'assets',
  'help', 'support', 'clio', 'vercel',
] as const
```

### 14.3 Vercel Domains API — Exact Request/Response Shapes

Called via the official `@vercel/sdk` package (approved for `CLAUDE.md`'s vendor list as part of this
brief — Requirement Doc Section 6), wrapped in `lib/partner/vercel-domains.ts`. Every function in that
file follows `lib/stripe.ts`'s `isPlaceholder` guard convention exactly: if `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` or
`VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` is a `PLACEHOLDER_` value, the function logs `console.log('[MOCK]', ...)` with what it
would have sent, and returns a realistic mock response shape (below) instead of making a network call.

**Add a domain** — `addDomainToProject(domain: string)`
```
Real call:  POST https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/{VERCEL_PROJECT_ID}/domains
            (Authorization: Bearer {VERCEL_API_TOKEN}, body: { "name": domain })

Success (verified immediately — rare, e.g. domain already correctly pointed):
  { "name": "learning.acme.com", "verified": true }

Success (pending — the common case):
  {
    "name": "learning.acme.com",
    "verified": false,
    "verification": [
      { "type": "CNAME", "domain": "learning.acme.com", "value": "cname.vercel-dns.com", "reason": "CNAME Record" }
    ]
  }

Error (domain already in use elsewhere — Vercel returns 409 with a structured error body):
  409 { "error": { "code": "domain_already_in_use", "message": "Domain is already in use by a different project." } }

Mock response (VERCEL_API_TOKEN placeholder):
  { "name": domain, "verified": false, "verification": [
      { "type": "CNAME", "domain": domain, "value": "cname.vercel-dns.com", "reason": "CNAME Record (mocked — no VERCEL_API_TOKEN configured)" }
  ] }
```
`addDomainToProject()`'s return type is a discriminated union: `{ ok: true, verified: boolean,
verification: VercelVerificationRecord[] | null }` or `{ ok: false, errorMessage: string }` — the calling
route (`POST /api/admin/configurator/domain/custom-domain`) maps `ok: false` to the `422`
`custom_domain_status: 'failed'` response (Requirement Doc Section 4.B.4) using `errorMessage` verbatim
as `custom_domain_error`, never a Clio-rewritten string.

**Check verification status** — `checkDomainVerification(domain: string)`
```
Real call:  GET https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/{VERCEL_PROJECT_ID}/domains/{domain}/config
            (Authorization: Bearer {VERCEL_API_TOKEN})

Response:   { "verified": true } | { "verified": false, "verification": [ ...same shape as above... ] }

Mock:       { "verified": false, "verification": [ ...same mocked record as above... ] } on first call;
            a mock implementation may optionally flip to { "verified": true } after a fixed number of
            calls purely to make manual/local testing of the "verified" screen state possible without a
            real token — this is a test-convenience detail, not a product behavior, and must never run in
            production (gated the same way every other mock stub in this codebase is: only when the
            underlying credential is a literal PLACEHOLDER_ string).
```

**Remove a domain** — `removeDomainFromProject(domain: string)`
```
Real call:  DELETE https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/{VERCEL_PROJECT_ID}/domains/{domain}
            (Authorization: Bearer {VERCEL_API_TOKEN})

Response:   200 (removed) or 404 (already not registered) — both treated as success by the caller
            (Requirement Doc Section 5.B.4/8). Any other error is logged, not surfaced to the partner.

Mock:       always returns { ok: true } and logs what it would have called.
```

### 14.4 API Route Map (Clerk-authenticated, `/api/admin/configurator/domain*` — added to
`middleware.ts`'s existing protected set alongside the other `/api/admin/configurator/*` routes; no
change needed there since those routes are already gated by `!isPublicRoute(request)` catching everything
under `/api/admin/*` that isn't explicitly listed as public)

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/configurator/domain` | Read all domain settings for a partner account (Requirement Doc 4.B.1) |
| GET | `/api/admin/configurator/domain/check-slug` | Live slug-availability check (4.B.2) |
| PATCH | `/api/admin/configurator/domain/subdomain` | Claim/change the subdomain slug (4.B.3) |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/domain/custom-domain` | Register a custom domain via Vercel (4.B.4) |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/domain/custom-domain/recheck` | Poll Vercel for verification status (4.B.5) |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/configurator/domain/custom-domain` | Deregister the custom domain (4.B.6) |

Every route calls `requirePartnerAdmin(partnerAccountId)` (`lib/partner/auth.ts`, unmodified) before any
DB or Vercel access, identical to every existing `/api/admin/configurator/*` route.

**Public, no auth (Host-resolved, not Clerk-gated):**

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| (rewrite target) | `/partner-questionnaire/[partner_account_id]` | Unchanged from B2B-03; now also reachable via a resolved Host + `/` or `/questionnaire` rewrite |
| (unchanged) | `/partner-render/[clio_session_ref]` | Unchanged from B2B-03; no new vanity path (Requirement Doc Section 10) |

### 14.5 `middleware.ts` — Exact Extension

The existing file (`isPublicRoute`, `clerkMiddleware` callback, `x-pathname` header injection, `config.matcher`)
is extended, not restructured. New logic is inserted inside the existing exported default callback, before
the existing `auth().protect()` gate, so a resolved tenant request never hits the Clerk redirect:

```ts
import { resolveTenantFromHost } from '@/lib/partner/domain-resolution'

const TENANT_SCOPED_PATTERNS = [
  /^\/$/,
  /^\/questionnaire$/,
  /^\/partner-questionnaire\/.+/,
  /^\/partner-render\/.+/,
]

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
  const host = (request.headers.get('host') ?? '').toLowerCase().split(':')[0]
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname
  const rootDomain = process.env.CLIO_ROOT_DOMAIN ?? ''

  const isTenantHost =
    rootDomain.length > 0 &&
    host !== rootDomain &&
    (host.endsWith(`.${rootDomain}`) || (await isVerifiedCustomDomain(host)))

  if (isTenantHost) {
    const tenant = await resolveTenantFromHost(host, rootDomain)
    const isTenantScopedPath = TENANT_SCOPED_PATTERNS.some((re) => re.test(pathname))

    if (!tenant || tenant.status !== 'active') {
      return neutralNotFoundResponse() // reuses the existing NeutralMessage copy, Requirement Doc 5.B.5
    }
    if (!isTenantScopedPath) {
      return neutralNotFoundResponse() // /dashboard, /api/admin/*, /sign-in, etc. never resolve on a partner domain
    }
    if (pathname === '/' || pathname === '/questionnaire') {
      const rewritten = request.nextUrl.clone()
      rewritten.pathname = `/partner-questionnaire/${tenant.partnerAccountId}`
      const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
      requestHeaders.set('x-clio-resolved-partner-account-id', tenant.partnerAccountId)
      requestHeaders.set('x-pathname', rewritten.pathname)
      return NextResponse.rewrite(rewritten, { request: { headers: requestHeaders } })
    }
    // /partner-questionnaire/(.*) or /partner-render/(.*) with the correct id/ref already in the path —
    // pass through unchanged, existing behavior.
  }

  // Existing, completely unmodified from here down:
  const isApiRoute = request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/')
  if (!isApiRoute && !isPublicRoute(request)) {
    auth().protect()
  }
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
  requestHeaders.set('x-pathname', request.nextUrl.pathname)
  return NextResponse.next({ request: { headers: requestHeaders } })
})
```

`isPublicRoute`'s array gains one new entry: `'/questionnaire'` (exact string, no wildcard) — required so
that a direct, non-tenant-resolved request to `https://{clio's own domain}/questionnaire` (e.g. hitting
the app before `CLIO_ROOT_DOMAIN` is configured, or in local dev) doesn't get redirected to `/sign-in`; on
Clio's own root domain with no resolvable tenant, this path simply falls through to a Next.js 404 (no
`app/questionnaire/page.tsx` exists), which is correct — the clean path is only ever meaningful under a
resolved partner host.

`resolveTenantFromHost(host, rootDomain)` (`lib/partner/domain-resolution.ts`):
```ts
export async function resolveTenantFromHost(
  host: string,
  rootDomain: string
): Promise<{ partnerAccountId: string; status: 'active' | 'suspended' } | null> {
  const supabase = createSupabaseAdminClient()
  if (host.endsWith(`.${rootDomain}`)) {
    const slug = host.slice(0, -(rootDomain.length + 1))
    const { data } = await supabase
      .from('partner_accounts')
      .select('id, status')
      .eq('subdomain_slug', slug)
      .maybeSingle()
    return data ? { partnerAccountId: data.id, status: data.status } : null
  }
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('partner_accounts')
    .select('id, status')
    .eq('custom_domain', host)
    .eq('custom_domain_status', 'verified')
    .maybeSingle()
  return data ? { partnerAccountId: data.id, status: data.status } : null
}
```
Note: a `custom_domain` row only ever resolves once `custom_domain_status = 'verified'` — a
`pending_verification` domain does not yet route real traffic to the partner (Vercel itself would not yet
have valid SSL/routing for it either, so this is consistent with reality, not an extra restriction Clio
invents).

### 14.6 Sequence — Middleware Edge Runtime Note

`middleware.ts` runs on Vercel's Edge Runtime by default under Next.js 14. `resolveTenantFromHost()`'s
Supabase read must use the existing `createSupabaseAdminClient()` helper (already Edge-compatible,
reused unmodified from every other `lib/partner/*` module) — no new Supabase client variant is introduced
by this document.

### 14.7 Onboarding Wizard (v1.1 amendment — Requirement Doc Section 13)

Companion to Requirement Doc Section 13. Adds one column to `partner_accounts`, one new table
(`partner_onboarding_progress`), three new API routes, and a redirect check added to every existing
Configurator `page.tsx`. Additive only — no existing route, table, or column from §14.1–14.6 is modified.

#### 14.7.1 Schema (migration, additive)

```sql
-- B2B-05 v1.1: onboarding wizard progress + go-live flag. Additive only.

ALTER TABLE partner_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Backfill: every partner_accounts row that exists BEFORE this migration runs is treated as
-- already onboarded. The wizard only ever intercepts accounts created after this ships
-- (Requirement Doc Section 13.3/13.9 — "no impact on existing", the standing project rule).
UPDATE partner_accounts
  SET onboarding_completed_at = COALESCE(onboarding_completed_at, created_at)
  WHERE onboarding_completed_at IS NULL;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partner_onboarding_progress (
  partner_account_id       UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES partner_accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

                               CHECK (current_step IN

```

The six `{step}_status`/`{step}_status_at` column pairs read/write via the `steps` object keyed by the same
six step-name strings in every API response below — never a positional array, so a developer never needs to
infer which index maps to which step.

#### 14.7.2 Per-step "complete" condition — exact read path

`POST /api/admin/configurator/wizard/advance` re-validates `action="complete"` server-side using these
existing read paths (no new query logic invented; each already backs an existing `GET` endpoint per §12):

| Step | Query |
|---|---|
| `questionnaire` | `SELECT 1 FROM questionnaires WHERE partner_account_id = $1 AND status = 'published' LIMIT 1` |
| `topics` | Existing `topics-config` row-presence check already used by `GET /api/admin/configurator/topics-config` (§12) |
| `content` | Existing `content-config` row-presence check already used by `GET /api/admin/configurator/content-config` (§12) |
| `visualization` | Existing theme row-presence check already used by `GET /api/admin/configurator/theme` (§12) |
| `domain` | `SELECT subdomain_slug FROM partner_accounts WHERE id = $1` — non-null passes; `custom_domain_status` is never inspected (Requirement Doc 13.5) |
| `payment` | `SELECT funding_mechanism FROM partner_wallets WHERE partner_account_id = $1` — non-null passes |

`action="skip"` never runs any of the above — it unconditionally sets that step's status to `'skipped'`.

#### 14.7.3 API Route Map (new, Clerk-authenticated, added to the existing `/api/admin/configurator/*` protected set — no `middleware.ts` change needed, same reasoning as §14.4)

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/configurator/wizard/progress` | Read (lazily create) `partner_onboarding_progress` for a partner account |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/wizard/advance` | Mark the server's current step `completed` or `skipped`; advances `current_step` |
| POST | `/api/admin/configurator/wizard/go-live` | Validate all 6 steps non-`pending`; set `partner_accounts.onboarding_completed_at` |

**`GET /api/admin/configurator/wizard/progress`** — query: `partner_account_id` (required, uuid).
Response 200:
```json
{
  "current_step": "topics",
  "onboarding_completed_at": null,
  "steps": {
    "questionnaire": { "status": "completed", "status_at": "2026-07-13T10:02:00Z" },
    "topics":        { "status": "pending",   "status_at": null },
    "content":       { "status": "pending",   "status_at": null },
    "visualization": { "status": "pending",   "status_at": null },
    "domain":        { "status": "pending",   "status_at": null },
    "payment":       { "status": "pending",   "status_at": null }
  }
}
```
403/400: same pattern as every other `/api/admin/configurator/*` route.

**`POST /api/admin/configurator/wizard/advance`** — body:
`{ "partner_account_id": "uuid", "step": "questionnaire"|"topics"|"content"|"visualization"|"domain"|"payment", "action": "complete"|"skip" }`.
Server re-validates `step === current partner_onboarding_progress.current_step` (never trusts the client to
name an arbitrary step — mirrors the existing "never trust a client-side-only check" discipline, §14
Requirement Doc 4.B.3). `action="complete"` additionally re-runs 14.7.2's query before accepting.
Response 200: `{ "current_step": "content", "steps": { ...same shape as GET... } }` (the next step in fixed
order becomes `current_step`; after `payment`, the next value is `go_live`).
Response 422: `{ "error": { "code": "step_not_ready" } }` — `action="complete"` attempted before the
condition was met.
Response 409: `{ "error": { "code": "step_mismatch" } }` — `step` no longer equals the server's
`current_step` (stale tab/double-submit).
403: same pattern.

**`POST /api/admin/configurator/wizard/go-live`** — body: `{ "partner_account_id": "uuid" }`.
Validates all six `{step}_status` values are `'completed'` or `'skipped'`.
Response 200: `{ "onboarding_completed_at": "2026-07-13T10:30:00Z", "live_url": "https://acme-co.hello-clio.com" }`.
`live_url` precedence (identical derivation to `GET .../domain`'s own display logic, §14.3/Requirement Doc
4.B.1): `custom_domain_url` if `custom_domain_status='verified'`, else `subdomain_url` if `subdomain_slug`
is set, else `{APP_BASE_URL}/partner-questionnaire/{partner_account_id}` (the existing, always-working
Clio-domain fallback — never blank).
Response 422: `{ "error": { "code": "steps_incomplete", "pending_steps": ["payment"] } }` — lists every
step still `'pending'`.
403: same pattern.

#### 14.7.4 Entry-point redirect — exact check added to every Configurator `page.tsx`

Every existing Configurator server component (`/dashboard/configurator`, `/questionnaire`, `/topics`,
`/content`, `/visualization`, and this document's own new `/domain`) gains this check, inserted immediately
after `activeId` resolution and before rendering its client component:

```ts
const { data: account } = await supabase
  .from('partner_accounts')
  .select('onboarding_completed_at')
  .eq('id', activeId)
  .single()

if (!account?.onboarding_completed_at) {
  redirect(`/dashboard/configurator/wizard?partner_account_id=${activeId}`)
}
```

`/dashboard/configurator/wizard/page.tsx` runs the inverse:

```ts
if (account?.onboarding_completed_at) {
  redirect(`/dashboard/configurator?partner_account_id=${activeId}`)
}
```

#### 14.7.5 `embedded` prop — exact shape added to the 5 wrapped client components

`QuestionnaireBuilderClient`, `TopicsConfigClient`, `ContentConfigClient`, `VisualizationClient` (all
B2B-03, unmodified otherwise), and `DomainConfigClient` (this document, Section 4.A) each gain:

```ts
interface Props {
  accounts: AdminPartnerAccount[]
  activePartnerAccountId: string
  embedded?: boolean   // new, optional, default false
}
```

**Correction (v1.2 review pass):** the two components below do not each have "exactly one wrapped
return" — verified against the live files. The fix differs by component depending on how many places
currently call `<ConfiguratorShell>`:

**`TopicsConfigClient`, `VisualizationClient`, `DomainConfigClient` — single wrapped return.**
Confirmed against the live code: `TopicsConfigClient.tsx` (one `<ConfiguratorShell>` at line 35) and
`VisualizationClient.tsx` (one `<ConfiguratorShell>` at line 25) each have exactly one early return, and
`DomainConfigClient` (new, Section 4.A) is being authored with exactly one. For these three, the original
instruction applies unchanged — the component's existing
`return (<ConfiguratorShell ...>{content}</ConfiguratorShell>)` becomes:

```tsx
if (embedded) return <>{content}</>
return (
  <ConfiguratorShell accounts={accounts} activePartnerAccountId={activePartnerAccountId} title="..." backHref="...">
    {content}
  </ConfiguratorShell>
)
```

**`QuestionnaireBuilderClient`, `ContentConfigClient` — two separately-wrapped returns each.**
Confirmed against the live code:
- `QuestionnaireBuilderClient.tsx` — the `view.mode === 'edit'` branch (lines 39–48, wraps `<EditView>`
  with `title="Questionnaire Builder" backHref="#"`) and the list/default branch (lines 53–104, wraps the
  New-button header + loading/empty/list states with `title="Questionnaire Builder"`, no `backHref`) each
  call `<ConfiguratorShell>` independently.
- `ContentConfigClient.tsx` — the `reviewingItem` branch (lines 61–70, wraps `<ReviewView>` with
  `title="Content — Review" backHref="#"`) and the default/list branch (lines 72–128, wraps the
  source-toggle + generated-items list with `title="Content" backHref="/dashboard/configurator?..."`)
  each call `<ConfiguratorShell>` independently.

**Specified approach: duplicate the `embedded` check at each of the two return sites independently — do
not collapse the component to a single check point.** Rationale: the two branches in each component
render genuinely different content *and* pass different `title`/`backHref` props to `ConfiguratorShell`
(edit/review branch uses `backHref="#"`, e.g.; the other branch doesn't, or uses a different one). A true
single-check refactor would need to thread per-branch title/backHref through a shared variable even
though neither prop is used at all when `embedded=true` — unnecessary complexity for no behavioral gain.
Duplicating the guard at each site instead requires no change to which branch executes, no change to
component structure or hook order, and keeps the "byte-identical content" promise mechanically verifiable
per branch: take the JSX already nested inside that branch's own `<ConfiguratorShell>` call, assign it
unchanged to a local `content` variable, then guard-return it immediately before the existing wrap. At
each of the two return sites:

```tsx
// at the top of the existing branch, in place of the current `return (<ConfiguratorShell ...>…)`:
const content = (
  /* exactly the JSX currently nested inside this branch's <ConfiguratorShell>…</ConfiguratorShell>,
     unchanged — no business logic, validation, or API call in this branch changes */
)
if (embedded) return <>{content}</>
return (
  <ConfiguratorShell accounts={accounts} activePartnerAccountId={activePartnerAccountId} title="..." backHref="...">
    {content}
  </ConfiguratorShell>
)
```

This is applied twice per component (once per branch), each independently — not once for the whole
component. A developer implementing this must not improvise a merged/single-check version; the two
branches keep their own separate `title`/`backHref` values exactly as today whenever `embedded=false`.

For all 5 components, `content` (the JSX nested inside the relevant `<ConfiguratorShell>` call) is
otherwise byte-identical — no business logic, validation, or API call inside any of the 5 components
changes.
